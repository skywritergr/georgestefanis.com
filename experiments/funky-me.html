	<h1>Hi! I'm George and i'm a developer.</h1>

	My Name is George Stefanis. I'm a Greek developer, living in London striving to create modern, functional, intuitive, good looking apps. I'm very interested in modern front end technologies and frameworks, improving User Experience, photography, good coffee and nice burgers. I currently work for Disney during the day, developing my own projects during the night, being a superhero whenever i can. Other things that make me excited are objective-C, Go language, Unity3D, travelling the world and cooking.

	I'm very thrilled about everything new related to JavaScript, ES6, new CSS standards, modern frameworks and pretty much anything i can get my hands on. I'm also a big fan of minimal design, clean interfaces and functional apps. This page is created as an example to apply new CSS attributes.
