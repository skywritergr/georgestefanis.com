After thinking about my site, and looking for a minimal and simple approach i ended up with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static sites framework written in ruby (which i love btw). It using markdown, Liquid and simple CSS3 and HTML. Overall is spartan, and i love it. No databases, no unnecessary stuff. Just the basics. Also the design is now extremely flat, using some nice fonts and hopefully a simpler structure than before. Hope you like it.
