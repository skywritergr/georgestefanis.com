A few minutes ago a friend of mine posted something that Charles Bukowski wrote, so I decided to go to Wikipedia (bless thy Wikipedia) and read about his life. Oh by miracle I’ve read one of the most inspiring quotes of my life, so here I share it with you.

Don’t try. "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: 'not' to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski)

Those simple things are epiphanies. Such a simple truth, written on a gravestone somewhere in the US. A mans entire life of experiences in a small sentence. Beat that twitter!

So next time you overstress about lack of inspiration or you get anxious on how to succeed remember… don’t try, just have your eyes and ears open and it will come. There is no guarantee about when…!

Happy new, successful, year everybody!
