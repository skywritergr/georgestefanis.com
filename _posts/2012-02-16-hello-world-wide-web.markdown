It has been more than 10 years since I wrote my first line of code and the first line of code I’ve even written was a “Hello world” header in an empty HTML page. Back then, that was a revelation; I could create something. It felt like I commanded my computer to do something for me. That’s how everything begun for me, as a software developer. After that very first hello world everything made sense. I wanted to learn more about software, and write many hello world messages.
 
That very first Hello World HTML message, back in 1999, had as a result my first homepage.  It was a web site that was offering virus removal tools and advices on how to remove viruses from your PC. It was a plain black background, white letters and it was hosted in Geocities (R.I.P). It was amazing! Some years later I stopped updating my website and eventually I lost all track of it.
 
Now, 14 years later, I have my own website again; this time a little bit more good looking, more than 2 colors and with my own domain name! I feel 15 years old again and I like it. This site is made using Drupal 7, an amazing CMS, and eventually will be a space were I can share my tech thoughts, and small bits of knowledge that I’d like to share with the rest of the world. I hope it will help some people around the world!
 
*So… Hello World!*
