With [performance.fail](http://performance.fail/) i wanted to create a playground for developer to be able to go and experiment with web improvement techniques. The website is intentionally slow and scores a very low score on [google pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/). You can find [the source code](https://github.com/skywritergr/slow-monstrosity) on GitHub. Feel free to clone, send a pull request to make it slower or any other suggestion. Also feel free to let me know how you improved it and what tools and techniques you used.
