![My Site v.2]({{site.url}}/assets/myOldSite.jpg)

After realizing that Drupal 7 is not needed for my case i decided to polish by PHP skills and learn a little bit about [codeigniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter). I ended up creating my own, small, simple CMS based on codeigniter. It only had an import article functionality and simple blog and static pages. Recently though i realized that even that is too much. I don't need databases and all that. :)
