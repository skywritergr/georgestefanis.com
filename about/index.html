    <p>My Name is George Stefanis. I'm a Greek developer, living in London striving to create modern, functional, intuitive, good looking apps. I'm interested in modern front end technologies, frameworks and improving User Experience. I love photography, running, good coffee and nice healthy food. I currently work for <strike><a href="http://www.disney.com">Disney</a></strike> <a href="https://www.transferwise.com">TransferWise</a> during the day, taking photos during the night. Other things that excite me are Swift, Python, travelling and cooking.</p>
