  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/George.png">
  <p>My Name is George Stefanis. I'm a Greek developer, living in London striving to create modern, functional, intuitive, good looking apps. I'm very interested in modern front end technologies and frameworks, improving User Experience, photography, good coffee and nice burgers. I currently work for <a href="http://www.disney.com">Disney</a> during the day, developing my own projects during the night, being a superhero whenever i can. Other things that make me excited are objective-C, <a href="http://golang.org/">Go language</a>, Unity3D, travelling the world and cooking.</p>
